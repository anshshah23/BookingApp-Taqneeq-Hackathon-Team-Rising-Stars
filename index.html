       <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Our service to provide E-vehicles on rental basis and to show the availability of convenient public transport is not only cost effective, but also has the ability to drastically reduce pollution when capitalised by commuters.
        We ensure people travel in an eco-friendly way without compromising with their comfort, budget and time. The running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel vehicle and it is a great way to 
        save our environment.Thus it works both ways 'by the people' and 'for the people'. Join us in this Electric Vehicle
        revolution and save your environment, country and Money! </p>

       <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">We provide passengers with the avaibility of public transport at the required time, as Public transport is 
        better anytime.As the City is running out of space for private vehicles, we try our best to convince people that greater adoption of public transport would help to reduce air pollution and free up space in the urban areas, making city 
        traffic significantly more pleasant for cyclists and pedestrians, in addition to making cityscapes across the world more beautiful and peaceful
        Due to vehicle congestion many cities have dedicated bus lanes, so using public transport within the city can be not only cheaper, but also faster.
        Especially when you don’t need worry about finding a parking space, or how much will it cost, when traveling on public transport.
